## Motivation

As a relatively new frontend developer, every time I complete a project, I share it on my social media to generate interactions with other devs and perhaps future work opportunities. With that said, one day I wanted to know the impact my social media posts were having. Despite the existence of already very good services, I challenged myself to create my own and make it open source to learn alongside others, and thus Countinkly was born.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Email Confirmation
- [ ] Password Recovery
- [ ] Tags on discover
- [ ] Users can add their own source

### Known Issues

- It seems that when using transitions with server actions, if an action fails, the transitions are not marked as completed.
- The function that handles the origin of the request is not working at this moment. (Currently working)
